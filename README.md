# bragging
Code for a project on identifying 'bragging' words used in 408,637 product descriptions and titles.

This project aims to extract information from small blurbs and headlines to identify those that use bragging when advertising a product. Bragging is defined as 'excessively proud and boastful talk about one's achievements or possessions.' In product advertisement, superlatives like 'most' or 'best' are defined to fall under bragging. 

This project is conducted in cooperation with a researcher in crowdfunding. For questions about the data please message me.
